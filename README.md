### Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hey all, thanks for stopping by! My name is Dennis and I'm currently working on my B.S. in Cyber Security with the intention of having that completed in Fall 2021. Other than that, I'm interested in everything IT and more specifically, cyber security. I have a background in systems engineering, automation, cyber compliance, information assurance and cyber security. Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Technical Project Manager and am working to develop myself more in that space and embrace the new challenge.

Right now, my current goals are to develop skills in both Dev(Sec)Ops, and Project Management (both traditional and Agile) as I have a huge interest in both fields. Any advice or words of encouragement are always welcomed!
