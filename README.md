### Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hey all, thanks for stopping by! My name is Dennis. I'm interested in everything IT and more specifically, automation and cybersecurity.

Right now, my current goals are to develop and grow my skills in Dev(Sec)Ops, system engineering, and overall cloud knowledge. Any advice or words of encouragement are always welcomed!
