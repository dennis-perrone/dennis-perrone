### Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hey all, thanks for stopping by! My name is Dennis and I just finished up my B.S. in Cybersecurity. I'm interested in everything IT and more specifically, program/product/project management and cybersecurity. I have a background in systems engineering, automation, cyber compliance, and administration. Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Vulnerability Manager where I'm working to develop myself more in that space and embrace the new challenge.

Right now, my current goals are to develop and hone my skills in Dev(Sec)Ops, product management, and overall cloud knowledge. Any advice or words of encouragement are always welcomed!
